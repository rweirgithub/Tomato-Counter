# tomato-counter

This tomato counter is used to practise the Pomodoro technique whereby you track your studying in 25 minute increments by counting tomatoes. I completed this project in line with the Scrimba Front-End Developer career path course, but the project and the code were all created and written by me. This was a fun project, and my first real upload to Github.
